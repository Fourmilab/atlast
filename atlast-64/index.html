<h1 class="title">ATLAST</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">Autodesk
Threaded Language Application System Toolkit</h2>

<h3 class="author">
by John Walker<br />
</h3>

<p>
<span class="a">Atlast</span> is an attempt to make software component
technology and open architecture applications commonplace in the
mainstream software market.  It is both a software component which can
be readily integrated into existing applications, providing them a
ready-made macro language and facilities for user extension and
customisation and, at the same time, it is a foundation upon which new
applications can be built in an open, component-oriented manner.
</p>

<p>
<span class="a">Atlast</span> was developed at Autodesk, Inc. 
Autodesk returned the rights to me in 1991, and I subsequently placed
the program in the public domain.  Autodesk's connection with this
program is purely historical: it is neither endorsed, used, nor supported
by Autodesk, Inc.
</p>

<p>
<span class="a">Atlast</span> is based upon the FORTH-83 language, but
has been extended in many ways and modified to better serve its
mission as an embedded toolkit for open, programmable applications. 
<span class="a">Atlast</span> is implemented in a single file, written
in portable C; it has been ported to many different machines and
operating systems, including MS-DOS, OS/2, the Macintosh, and a wide
variety of Unix machines.  <span class="a">Atlast</span> includes
native support for floating point, C-like strings, Unix-compatible
file access, and a wide variety of facilities for embedding within
applications.  Integers are 32 bits (64 bits in the 64-bit version of
<span class="a">Atlast</span>) and identifiers can be up to 127
characters; extensive stack and heap pointer checking is available to
aid in debugging.  <span class="a">Atlast</span> may be configured at
compilation time to include only the facilities needed by a given
application, thus saving memory and increasing execution speed (when
error checking is disabled).
</p>

<hr class="sep" />

<p>
The following extract from the <a href="atlast.html"><span
class="a">Atlast</span> manual</a> describes the rationale for the
development of <span class="a">Atlast</span> and its intended scope of
applications.
</p>

<p>
Virtually every industry analyst agrees that open architecture is
essential to the success of applications.  And yet, even today, we
write program after program that is closed&mdash;that its users cannot
program&mdash;that admits of no extensions without our adding to its source
code.  If we believe intellectually, from a sound understanding of the
economic incentives in the marketplace, that open systems are better,
and have seen this belief confirmed repeatedly in the marketplace,
then the only question that remains is why?  Why not make every
program an open program?
</p>

<p>
Well, because it's <i>hard</i>!  Writing a closed program has
traditionally been much less work at every stage of the development
cycle: easier to design, less code to write, simpler documentation,
and far fewer considerations in the test phase.  In addition, closed
products are believed to be less demanding of support, although I'll
argue later that this assumption may be incorrect.
</p>

<h3>The painful path to programmability</h3>

<p>
Most programs start out as nonprogrammable, closed applications, then
painfully claw their way to programmability through the introduction
of a limited script or macro facility, succeeded by an increasingly
comprehensive interpretive macro language which grows like topsy and
without a coherent design as user demands upon it grow.  Finally,
perhaps, the program is outfitted with bindings to existing languages
such as C.
</p>

<p>
An alternative to this is adopting a standard language as the macro
language for a product.  After our initial foray into the awful menu
macro language that still burdens us, AutoCAD took this approach,
integrating David Betz&rsquo; XLISP, a simple Lisp interpreter which
was subsequently extended by Autodesk to add floating point, many
additional Common Lisp functions, and, eventually, access to the
AutoCAD database.
</p>

<p>
This approach has many attractions.  First, choosing a standard
language allows users to avail themselves of existing books and
training resources to learn its basics.  The developer of a dedicated
macro language must create all this material from scratch.  Second,
an interpretive language, where all programs are represented in ASCII
code, is inherently portable across computers and operating systems. 
Once the interpreter is gotten to work on a new system, all the
programs it supports are pretty much guaranteed to work.  Third, most
existing languages have evolved to the point that most of the rough
edges have been taken off their design.  Extending an existing
language along the lines laid down by its designers is much less
likely to result in an incomprehensible disaster than growing an
ad-hoc macro language feature by neat-o feature.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, interpreters are <i>slow</i>, <i>slow</i>, <i>slow</i>.
 A simple calculation of the number of instructions of overhead per
instruction that furthers the execution of the program quickly
demonstrates that no interpreter is suitable for serious computation.
 As long as the interpreter is deployed in the role of a macro
language, this may not be a substantial consideration.  Most early
AutoLISP&reg;
programs, for example, spent most of their time submitting commands
to AutoCAD with the <tt>(command)</tt>
function.  The execution time of the program was overwhelmingly
dominated by the time AutoCAD took to perform the commands, not the
time AutoLISP spent constructing and submitting them.  However, as
soon as applications tried to do substantial computation, for example
the parametric object calculations in AutoCAD AEC, the overhead of
AutoLISP became a crushing burden, verging on intolerable.  The
obvious alternative was to provide a compiled language.  But that,
too, has its problems.
</p>

<h2>Introducing <span class="a">Atlast</span></h2>

<p>
<span class="a">Atlast</span>&trade; is a toolkit that makes
applications programmable.  Deliberately designed to be easy to
integrate both into existing programs and newly-developed ones,
<span class="a">Atlast</span> provides any program that incorporates it most
of the benefits of programmability with very little explicit effort on
the part of the developer.  Indeed, once you begin to &ldquo;think
<span class="a">Atlast</span>&rdquo; as part of the design cycle,
you'll probably find that the way you design and build programs
changes substantially.  I'm coming to think of
<span class="a">Atlast</span> as the &ldquo;monster that feeds on
programs,&rdquo; because including it in a program tends to shrink the
amount of special-purpose code that would otherwise have to be written
while resulting in finished applications that are open, extensible,
and more easily adapted to other operating environments such as the
event driven paradigm.
</p>

<p>
The idea of a portable toolkit, integrated into a wide variety of
products, all of which thereby share a common programming language
seems obvious once you consider its advantages.  It's surprising that
such packages aren't commonplace in the industry.  In fact, the only
true antecedent to <span class="a">Atlast</span> I've encountered in
my whole twisted path through this industry was the universal macro
package developed in the mid 1970s by Kern Sibbald and Ben Cranston
at the University of Maryland.  That package, implemented on Univac
mainframes, provided a common macro language shared by a wide variety
of University of Maryland utilities, including a text editor,
debugger, file dumper, and typesetting language.  While <span
class="a">Atlast</span> is entirely different in structure and
operation from the Maryland package, which was an interpretive string
language, the concept of a cross-product macro language and
appreciation of the benefits to be had from such a package are
directly traceable to those roots.
</p>

<h2>Summary and Conclusions</h2>

<p>
Everything should be programmable.  <i>Everything!</i>  I have come to
the conclusion that to write almost any program in a closed manner is
a mistake that invites the expenditure of uncounted hours
&ldquo;enhancing&rdquo; it over its life cycle.  Further tweaks,
&ldquo;features,&rdquo; and &ldquo;fixes&rdquo; often result in a
product so massive and incomprehensible that it becomes unlearnable,
unmaintainable, and eventually unusable.
</p>

<p>
Far better to invest the effort up front to create a product flexible
enough to be adapted at will, by its users, to their immediate needs.
If the product is programmable in a portable, open form, user
extensions can be exchanged, compared, reviewed by the product
developer, and eventually incorporated into the mainstream of the
product.
</p>

<p>
It is far, far better to have thousands of creative users expanding
the scope of one's product in ways the original developers didn't
anticipate&mdash;in fact, working for the vendor without pay, than it
is to have thousands of frustrated users writing up wish list requests
that the vendor can comply with only by hiring people and paying them
to try to accommodate the perceived needs of the users.  Open
architecture and programmability not only benefits the user, not only
makes a product better in the technical and marketing sense, but
confers a direct economic advantage upon the vendor of such a
product&mdash;one mirrored in a commensurate disadvantage to the
vendor of a closed product.
</p>

<p>
The chief argument against programmability has been the extra
investment needed to create open products.
<span class="a">Atlast</span> provides a way of building open products in
the same, or less, time than it takes to construct closed ones.  Just
as no C programmer in his right mind would sit down and write his own
buffered file I/O package when a perfectly fine one was sitting in the
library, why re-invent a macro language or other parameterisation and
programming facility when there's one just sitting there that's as
fast as native C code for all but the most absurd misapplications,
takes very little memory with every gew-gaw and optional feature at its
command enabled all at once, is portable to any machine that supports
C by simply recompiling a single file, and can be integrated into a
typical application at a basic level in less than 15 minutes?
</p>

<p>
Am I proposing that every application suddenly look like FORTH?  Of
course not; no more than output from PostScript printers looks like
PostScript, or applications that run on 80386 processors resemble
80386 assembly language.  <span class="a">Atlast</span> is an
intermediate language, seen only by those engaged in implementing and
extending the product.  Even then, <span class="a">Atlast</span> is a
chameleon which, with properly defined words, can look like almost
anything you like, even at the primitive level of the interpreter.
</p>

<p>
Again and again, I have been faced with design situations where I
knew that I really needed programmability, but didn't have the time,
the memory, or the fortitude to face the problem squarely and solve
it the right way.  Instead, I ended up creating a kludge that
continued to burden me through time.  This is just a higher level
manifestation of the nightmares perpetrated by old-time programmers
who didn't have access to a proper dynamic memory allocator or linked
list package.  Just because programmability is the magic smoke of
computing doesn't mean we should be spooked by the ghost in the
machine or hesitant to confer its power upon our customers.
</p>

<p>
Don't think of <span class="a">Atlast</span> as FORTH.  Don't think of
it as a language at all.  The best way to think of
<span class="a">Atlast</span> is as a library routine that gives you
<i>programmability</i>, in the same sense other libraries provide file
access, window management, or graphics facilities.  The whole concept
of &ldquo;programmability in a can&rdquo; is odd&mdash;it took me two
years to really got my end effector around it and crush it into
submission.  Think about it; play with it; and you may discover a
better way to build applications.
</p>

<p>
Open is better.  <span class="a">Atlast</span> lets you build open
programs in less time than you used to spend writing closed ones. 
Programs that inherit their open architecture from <span
class="a">Atlast</span> will share, across the entire product line and
among all hardware platforms that support it, a common, clean, and
efficient means of user extensibility.  The potential benefits of this
are immense.
</p>

<h2>32- or 64-bit?</h2>

<p>
Ever since its initial release in 1990, <span class="a">Atlast</span>
has supported a memory architecture in which integers and pointers
were 32-bit values and floating point numbers were 64 bits.  Because
FORTH-derived languages allow the user access to memory at a low
level, these assumptions were visible to the programmer and had
consequences in code.  Programs which used floating point numbers
had to be conscious of the fact that floating point quantities occupied
two stack items.
</p>

<p>
The advent of 64-bit systems poses a problem for such code but
simultaneously makes it possible to dramatically simplify the
memory architecture of <span class="a">Atlast</span>.  Rather
than creating a kludge which would run in 64-bit mode while
preserving compatibility with existing programs written for the
32-bit version, I have opted to create a new 64-bit version in
which all data types&mdash;integers, pointers, and floating point
numbers&mdash;are the same length.  This means that floating point
code can now use the same stack operators as integer code, and
keeping track of the stack is much simpler.  This comes at the cost
of breaking source compatibility with existing programs, especially
those which use floating point values.  There is, however, a
simple solution.  Users with existing programs can continue to use
them by building a 32-bit version of <span class="a">Atlast</span>
from the 1.<em>x</em> source code and compiling it in 32-bit memory
mode on their 64-bit system (this may require installing some libraries,
but is otherwise straightforward).  Then their existing programs will
continue to run without any modifications.
</p>

<p>
Users wishing to develop new code who are confident that all of the
platforms on which it is deployed will be 64-bit may opt to use an
<span class="a">Atlast</span> 2.<em>x</em> release which uses the
simpler memory architecture and provides a larger address space and
integers.  If you are developing code for an embedded platform with
a 32-bit architecture, you should use a 1.<em>x</em> release
even if you're developing on a 64-bit system, but unless you use
floating point (which few embedded applications do), it's unlikely
you'll have problems migrating source code between versions.
