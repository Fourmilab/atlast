Changed the development version to 1.2.

Added a new READONLYSTRINGS package configuration definition which
causes the names of primitive words to be copied to a monolithic
buffer in which WORDSUSED may tag them when used without running
afoul of GCCs fascist enforcement of read-only strings.  Note that
even if READONLYSTRINGS is defined, the copy of the primitive names
is made only if WORDSUSED is also defined.

Created a new "dist" target which builds the distribution archive
automatically, containing only the files it is supposed to
include, regardless of the contents of the development directory.

Updated the MANIFEST to reflect files included in the current
distribution.  Removed the obsolete RTF version of the manual.
Replaced the PostScript version of the LaTeX manual with a PDF
edition.

Removed READONLYSTRINGS from the package configuration section
and made it a global configuration parameter, set by default from
the C compiler command-line options in the Makefile.  It is not
really a package and fits better as a global configuration item,
which is how it is now documented.

Completed the transmogrification of the manual into XHTML 1.0
Strict.  Retrofitted substantive changes to the LaTeX manual
and rebuilt the PDF.

Removed the README from the MANIFEST and distribution; it is replaced
by the XHTML documentation.  A place-holder README will be placed in
the Web tree which directs anybody who links to it to the Web
documentation.

Modified the command line processing code in atlmain.c to
dispense with an erroneous "uninitialised variable" natter
from GCC 4.1.2 in -O3 -Wall mode.

Modified P_strreal in atlast.c to use a union to place
the scanned floating point number onto the stack instead
of the cast pointer which sufficed for the last 17 years.
GCC 4.1.2 not only generates a:
   dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules
warning in -O3 -Wall mode, it actually generates incorrect
code for this case.

Modified the TokReal case of atl_eval in atlast.c to use a union
to store a scanned real number token onto the compiled output
(comple state) or the stack (execution state).  This avoids the
GCC natter mentioned above which, in this case, did not generate
incorrect code with the -O3 option.

If READONLYSTRINGS was defined, atl_primdef() in atlast.c failed to
correctly add the names of user-defined primitives to the dictionary
because it erroneously referenced the built-in primitive table (primt)
rather than the primitive table passed as the argument (pt)--fixed.

The sample main program in the "Integrating Atlast" section of the
manual would generate a compiler warning on GCC with -Wall because
the main program was not declared as returning an int--fixed.

Added a new primdeftest.c program, which tests definition of the
TIME and HHMMSS primitives as documented in the manual, to the
MANIFEST and source distribution.
